This Repository is an Attempt to create a Platformer using **GDevelop 5** game engine. The name is likely to change later on. Moereover,
we are likely to work in teams rather than individually so your performance/contribution will be a major factor.

### Trying the game out

The game is being automatically built on every commit to master. Try it out here: https://gdevelop-game.github.io/Open-Platformer/.
